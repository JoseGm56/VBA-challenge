# VBA-challenge

All the code is mine I had some help from the AskBs Tutors but it was mostly clarification 
on the instruction. I did also did some further reaserch on the percentaging formating on 
stack overflow, where I leaned about the .NumbertFormat code line. 

The code gets the data from the excel and outputs the ticker symbol, the yearly change, 
percent change and total stock volume, after that it gets the stock with the greatest 
percent increade, decrease and greatest total volume. Places that data in own seperate 
little table.
